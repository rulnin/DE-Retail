The data model follows a traditional star schema optimized for analytical queries:
1. Fact Table:
* fact_transactions â€“ contains all transactional-level data (InvoiceNo, Date, Quantity, TotalAmount)
2. Dimension Tables:
* dim_customer â€“ customer information
* dim_product â€“ product details
* dim_date â€“ date dimension for time-based analytics
